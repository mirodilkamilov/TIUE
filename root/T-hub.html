            <p class="text-center">IELTS (International English Language Testing System) is the world's most popular
              English language proficiency test. <br>

              Students starting this course must have a good knowledge of basic English, which is useful when taking the
              IELTS exams. While studying the IELTS test system, students also develop General English skills. <br>

              IELTS preparation courses use a free and informal approach to choosing the curriculum for each level
              consisting of four modules, as well as when choosing the methods of teaching and learning the language
              used in the classroom.

            conjectures; they resolve
            the truth or falsity of such by mathematical proof. When mathematical structures are good models of real
            phenomena, mathematical reasoning can be used to provide insight or predictions about nature. Through the
            use of abstraction and logic, mathematics developed from counting, calculation, measurement, and the
            systematic study of the shapes and motions of physical objects. Practical mathematics has been a human
            activity from as far back as written records exist. The research required to solve mathematical problems
            can take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry. </p>
